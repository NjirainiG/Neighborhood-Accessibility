# Neighborhood Quality Nairobi, Kenya -Accessibility dimension 

We are creating a Neighborhood Quality Index for urban areas in Kenya. The objective is to create spatial data and information to help residents make decisions about where they live work and play. We hope to create and share data that improves peoples lives and their wellbeing.  

This repository provides information about the number of job locations, schools and hospitals accessible within 15 minutes from each Neighborhood in Nairobi. 

We used data from OSM and the R5PY algorithim to calculate accessiblity. 

In the near future we will provide more data covering the following dimensions
1. Accessibility 
2. Environmental quality e.g greeness and flood prediction 
3. Density
4. Design 
5. Road and transport infrastructure 
6. Utilities 
7. Zoning policy 
8. Suitability analysis for residential, commercial, recreational uses
